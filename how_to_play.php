        <ol>
            <li>
                Pick the winner of one (1) Premier League match each week. If your selection wins you progress to the next week, lose or draw (see point 2) and you're out.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                For just one round of fixtures you are allowed to nominate the win AND the draw. This means that if you select Team A with Draw and Team A wins or draws then you are through to the next round.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                You may not pick the same team to win more than once during the tournament (unless the tournament progresses past 20 weeks).
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                All selections must be received before the first match in the round kicks off.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                Should you forget to make your selection in any round, you will automatically be assigned the first team that you have not selected in alphabetical order. Once a team is selected, you will be able to change them up until the cut-off time for selections for that round. 
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                In the event that any match involving a team you have selected is postponed or canceled for any reason, you will continue to the next round. However, that team will no longer be available for selection.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                A new tournament will commence each week and the above tournament rules apply. Customers are permitted to join multiple tournaments.

                Should two or more participants remain standing and all are eliminated in the same week, the Last Man Standing prize will be distributed equally among them.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
